### ðŸŒ­ Hotdog | Not Hotdog Dataset

Here you will find the test and training images for the Hotdog | Not Hotdog dataset. The goal is to have a fun set of images to use for binary classification. See the code section for examples of models that work well for this purpose.

#### Files

This dataset contains:

- **Training** images to be used for developing a binary classification model
    - `2121` images of hot dogs, and `2121` images of other items
- **Test** images to be used after training a binary classification model
    - `200` images of hot dogs, and `200` images of other items

The total number of images is, of course, `2x2121` for training and `2x200` for testing, with a total of `4,642` files.
